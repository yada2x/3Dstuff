# 3Dstuff

This is a small project I did to challenge myself in C++ as well as learn the new SDL3 library.
Currently, you can use edges and vertices to construct 3D objects (cubes, pyramids, prisms, etc), and then rotate them, creating simple and satisfying graphics.
I learnt a great deal about rendering with SDL3 and the various mathematics required to go about doing it! 7/10 project imo
